          <li>Government annual reports, budgets, and financial statements</li>

          <li>Media reporting and public announcements</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All sources are documented and referenced. Every claim is traceable to public records. Analysis is replicable by accessing the same public sources.</p>
        <p>DDA does not:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li>Access confidential or proprietary information</li>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#F3EFE6]">4. SCOPE OF ANALYSIS AND LIMITATIONS</h2>
        <p>DDA analysis identifies structural patterns, quantifies observable gaps between reported outcomes and system behavior, and models implications. Analysis does not:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li>Determine causation at individual actor level (focuses on system-level patterns)</li>
          <li>Access information withheld from public record</li>
          <li>Predict precise future outcomes (offers scenario ranges and confidence levels)</li>
          <li>Make legal determinations or regulatory judgments</li>
          <li>Establish factual findings for litigation purposes without proper discovery process</li>
          <li>Substitute for internal audits, regulatory reviews, or official investigations</li>
          <li>Guarantee outcomes or results from recommendations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All deliverables clearly distinguish between:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
          <li>High-confidence findings (directly supported by public evidence)</li>
          <li>Medium-confidence findings (strongly suggested but partially unobservable)</li>
          <li>Unassessable domains (where opacity or missing data prevents evaluation)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Clients receive explicit statements of data gaps, limitations, and unknowables.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#F3EFE6]">5. DELIVERABLES AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
