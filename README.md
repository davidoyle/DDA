## 1) Homepage text (exact)

### Hero / opening

**Eyebrow:**
`DDA`

**Headline:**
`I find what's broken in your system.`

**Subheadline:**
`You get the numbers. You decide what to do.`

**Body paragraphs:**
`Most organizations operate on assumptions about how their systems work. When reality diverges from those assumptions, the cost compounds silently until crisis forces recognition.`

`I reverse-engineer that gap. I use public data—the documents your organization publishes but never looks at as a whole. I find the patterns. I quantify the impact. I hand you the evidence.`

`Then you decide.`

### Assumed vs Actual block

**Section title:**
`Assumed Performance vs Actual Performance`

**Supporting line:**
`The hidden gap is where pressure builds.`

### Problem-identification block

**Step 1 body:**
`Use the contact form. Tell me what's happening in your system. Your timeline. Your budget.`

**Step 2 title:**
`Step 2: I Analyze The Public Data`

**Step 2 body:**
`I read the documents your organization publishes. Annual reports. Budgets. Policy. Decisions. I find the pattern.`

**Step 3 title:**
`Step 3: You Get The Numbers`

**Step 3 body:**
`I give you a document. With evidence. With numbers. With what needs to change.`

**Process closer:**
`You don't get a consulting project. You get an answer.`

### Offer framing block

### Founder block

**Section headline:**
`Who I am.`

**Body lines:**
`I'm a forensic institutional analyst. I read public documents. I find patterns others miss. I quantify what's actually happening. I tell you the truth about your systems.`

`I don't do consulting. I don't do meetings. I don't do "stakeholder alignment."`

`I read. I analyze. I write. I deliver.`

`I work at speed because I don't have overhead. I work alone. I work from public data. Every claim I make is sourced. Every number is verifiable.`

`I've been inside broken systems. I know what they cost. I know how to find the gap between what people think is happening and what's actually happening.`

`That's what I do.`

### Final CTA block

**Section headline:**
`You know what you need.`

**Body lines:**
`Tell me about your problem. Your timeline. Your budget range. I'll respond within 48 hours with a preliminary assessment and scope options.`
